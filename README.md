## [Check this project Deploy](https://nekelpatrick.github.io/nekeldev-design-system/?path=/story/home--page)

Welcome to my design system documentation, built with Storybook. I intend to keep my entire design process documented, which will be implemented in all my side projects.

Here's the [Source Code](https://github.com/nekelpatrick/nekeldev-design-system) of this repo.

## Bonus

[Check out my portfolio](https://patrick-nekel.vercel.app/), which is being refactored to use this Design System.

Also, my [Simple Pomodoro](https://simple-pomodoro-nekel.vercel.app/) application.
